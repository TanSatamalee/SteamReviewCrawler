# SteamReviewCrawler

Mostly leftover and unused code from the steam analysis project. Both methods generate a file (pandas array) of user reviews for a particular game on steam. 

## Web Crawler

This directly scrapes reviews from the steam website given some url to the main steam review that infinitly scrolls down.

## Steam API

This uses the Steamworks API provided by Steam to call for and gather reviews through that.
